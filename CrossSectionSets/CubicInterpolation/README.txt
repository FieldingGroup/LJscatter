Cross-section sets guide.
These cross-section sets were extrapolated linearly to 0 eV and interpolated with a cubic spline.
NB: cross-sections set 4 was digitised and not inter/extrapolated.

1b:	Extrapolated single ice cross-sections
2:	Extrapolated droplet cross-sections
4:	Digitised by me
5:	Extrapolated revised droplet cross-sections
