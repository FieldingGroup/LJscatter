### Cross-section sets guide.

These cross-section sets were extrapolated linearly to 0 eV and interpolated with a cubic spline.
NB: cross-sections set I was digitised and not inter/extrapolated.

- Set I:      Digitised from Science Advances 2017, 3, e1603224.
- Set II:     Extrapolated cross-sections obtained from Physical Review Letters 2020, 124, 205501.
- Set III:    Extrapolated cross-sections obtained from Radiation Research 2003, 159, 3–22.
- Set IV:	    Extrapolated cross-sections obtained from Chemical Physics Letters 2016, 658, 1–6 and Chemical Physics Letters 2016, 658, 1–6.

Details of the extrapolation and iterpolation procedure can be found in [Simonetti and Fielding, 2025](https://doi.org/10.26434/chemrxiv-2025-1hvbm).
